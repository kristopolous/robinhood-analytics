# Robby

This is a standalone portfolio analyzer without any trading or bot things built in.

Right now it's kinda teaching me the hard way about what stocks I should have just held and which ones I should be more involved with.

If you want documentation please file a ticket and I'll write it. Thanks!

## Notes 

This is from a small game I wrote in 2019 but I'm releasing it as a standalone portfolio analyzer
